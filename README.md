Flips notes around the first note of a midi file
If the sequence of notes in the midi file are E, F, G, this program would flip the "value" of each note around the first note and create a new midi file for that sequence, which in this case would result in the sequence E, D, C. 
This program was inspired by the music Youtube channel: Andrew Huang. He did this to a midi file of Fur Elise manually, and I wanted to do it too, except I was too lazy to do it by hand. So, I wrote this.
